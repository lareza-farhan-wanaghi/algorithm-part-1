# Description
This repo contains my assignment projects for the "Algorithm Part 1" course.

## Inner-folders descriptions:
- <strong>hello</strong>: Solutions for the week 1 section "Percolation" assignment. Activities included: Implementing a weighted union data structure and its algorithm to solve a scientific problem called percolation.

- <strong>queues</strong>: Solutions for the week 2 section "Stacks and Queues" assignment. Activities included: Creating a data structure that can store and retrieve an item from the beginning and end of a collection, using a 2-tail linked list. [Learn more](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)
- <strong>collinear</strong>: Solution for the week 3 section "Mergesort" assignment. Activities included: Implementing java comparator and sorting algorithms to find groups of collinear points. [Learn more](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php)
- <strong>8puzzle</strong>: Solution for the week 4 section "Priority Queues" assignment. Activities included: Making an A* AI algorithm to solve n-puzzle problems. This is done by using manhattan distance as the heuristic and a Priority Queue data structure to iterate over possible moves within a given puzzle.

- <strong>kdtree</strong>: Solution for the week 5 section "Geometric Application of BSTs" assignment. Activities included: Making a Kd-tree-like data structure to range search points intersecting a given rectangle and find the nearest point of a given position.
