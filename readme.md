# Description
This repo contains all assignment projects for the "Algorithm Part 1" course.

## Inner-folders descriptions:
- hello: Solutions for the week 1 assignment, "Percolation". Activities included: Implementing a weighted union algorithm to solve a scientific problem called percolation. [See the official description of this assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)
- queues: Solutions for the week 2 assignment, "Stacks and Queues". Activities included: Creating a data structure that can store and retrieve an item from the beginning and end of a collection, using a 2-tail linked list. [See the official description of this assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)
- collinear: Solution for the week 3 assignment, "Mergesort". Activities included: Implementing java comparator and sorting algorithms to find groups of collinear points. [See the official description of this assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php)
- 8 puzzle: Solution for the week 4 assignment, "Priority Queues". Activities included: Making an A* AI algorithm to solve n-puzzle problems. This is done by using manhattan distance as its heuristic and Priority Queue data structure to iterate over possible steps within the game. [See the official description of this assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle/specification.php)
- kdtree: Solution for the week 5 assignment, "Geometric Application of BSTs". Activities included: Making a Kd-tree-like data structure to range search points intersecting a given rectangle and find the nearest point of a given position.
